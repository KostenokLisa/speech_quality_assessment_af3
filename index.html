           e.g. <strong>How would you rate the noise level in the audio? Use the following scale to describe its impact:
5. Not noticeable, 4. Slightly noticable, 3. Noticeable but not intrusive, 2. Somewhat intrusive, 1. Very intrusive.</strong>

However, the audio is very smooth, with no breaks or stutters, allowing for a seamless listening experience. The listener experiences complete relaxation and requires no effort to understand the content, which is a positive aspect. The naturalness of the speech is somewhat lacking, as it does not fully resemble natural human speech, and the speaking speed is moderate.

                    <td>The speech sample presents a very low level of background noise, making it easy to focus on the content. However, there is noticeable distortion characterized by pitch alterations and a mechanical sound, particularly between 0.5 to 2 seconds, which detracts from the overall clarity. The audio is mostly smooth with only minor interruptions, allowing for a relatively seamless listening experience. Understanding the speech requires moderate effort, indicating that while the message is somewhat accessible, it is not entirely effortless. The naturalness of the voice is lacking, especially between 1 to 1.5 seconds, where it sounds fairly unnatural. The speaking speed is moderate, contributing to a balanced delivery. Overall, the voice, described as that of a young woman, carries a mechanical tone that feels somewhat odd. Collectively, these factors suggest a fair quality of speech, with room for improvement in naturalness and distortion.</td>
